General Security Rules (Apply Across Languages)
DO NOT hardcode secrets, credentials, or API keys in code. Use environment variables or secure vaults.
Prohibit the inclusion of .env, secret config files, or unknown tokens.
Make sure to never log sensitive data, secrets or session tokens.

Input validation and outputs
Validate and sanitize all user input. Escape output in HTML, JS, and SQL contexts.
Avoid as much as possible using unsafe functions like “exec” or “eval”. 

DB and query security
Use parameterized queries for all database access. (ORM preferred).
Related to the first rule : Don’t allow string concatenation for query building.

Dependency controls
Packages must be fetched from verified sources.
Do not add new dependencies without explicit approval. 

Authentication and authorization
Use secure authentication frameworks; never roll your own.
Store passwords using strong, salted hashes like Argon2, to avoid dictionary-based cyberattacks.
Implement RBAC for sensitive operations.
Enforce principle of least privilege (zero trust framework) in APIs and UI actions

Transport and secure session
Do not expose stack traces or internal messages/errors to users.
Use secure (https), HTTP-only, SameSite cookies for sessions (aka security feature for http cookies that defines how cookies are sent along with cross site requests).
Set CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options headers for all web applications.
Log security events, but never log sensitive data. 

Cryptographic Practices
Never reuse the same IV (initialization vector) to seed encryption. (no static iv or non random salts).
Use secure libraries instead of manual implementations.
Cryptographic functions must be implemented on the server side; or utilizing a trusted system (such as transaction signing utilizing an HSM or similar hardware cryptographic function providers including but not limited to a TPM or Yubikey).
Secrets must never be stored on the client side.
Cryptographic modules should fail securely, operating in a fail-closed manner, whereby cryptographic controls must not be skipped in the event of failure.
Cryptographic controls must be compliant to FIPS 140-2 or an equivalent standard.

Audit and review requirements
Require security tests (SAST/DAST) and code review for all PRs affecting auth, data, or user input.
Audit all rule files for unauthorized changes and invisible characters. 

AI code safety
Check for obfuscated characters within the rule like Zero Width Joiner, bidirectional text markers which could hide instructions.
Analyze all the instructions, alone and combined, to reveal any potential context manipulation during the code generation.
No blind usage of AI-generated code. It needs to be verified.
Analyze potential bad prompts with bad patterns, which could lead to AI generating insecure code.
